# SkiaSharp Demo App

This is just a simple Visual Basic demonstration app which shows
how to do a few tasks using SkiaSharp and Xamarin.Forms:

 * Add a `SKCanvasView` (for Xamarin.Forms) to a page
 * Attach a handler to the `PaintSurface` event
 * Clear the canvas
 * Create a `SKPaint` instance
 * Draw a simple circle
 * Draw a `SKPath`
 * Draw text
